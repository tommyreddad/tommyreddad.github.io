**[Curriculum Vitae (pdf)][cv]**

I'm a developer and computer scientist based in Montréal. My academic
work concerns applied probability theory, statistics, and the analysis
of algorithms. Lover of games, maths, and bread.

Ex-PhD student of [Luc Devroye][luc-devroye] at McGill University,
where I worked on many different problems concerning random graphs,
neural networks, minimax density estimation, and properties of
Galton-Watson trees. Completed a Master of Computer Science at the
[Computational Geometry Lab][cg-lab] at Carleton University in Ottawa,
under the supervision of [Pat Morin][pat-morin], [Vida
Dujmović][vida-dujmovic], and [Jit Bose][jit-bose], where I produced a
thesis on <em>Encoding Arguments</em>.
