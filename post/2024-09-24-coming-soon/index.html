	<p>I&rsquo;ve been messing around in my free time doing a bit of coding for fun
and to explore areas of interest. It&rsquo;s a bit hard to motivate myself
to code during my free time considering coding is also part of my day
job. But my day job is not very technically interesting, so this is
how I get to explore the fun of coding. I&rsquo;ll briefly describe a few of
these projects which I have in mind.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-design">Compiler design</h2>
<p>I never studied compiler design and I don&rsquo;t really have a good idea
about how they work. I&rsquo;m sure this is a very deep and interesting
subject, and I&rsquo;m particularly interested in compiler optimizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to just roughly follow along the curriculum in a publicly
posted course at my alma mater McGill University:
<a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2017/">https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2017/</a>. I noticed much of the course
materials, assignments, and homeworks, are posted on that
webpage. I&rsquo;ll also be reading the book recommended in the course
outline, <em>Crafting a Compiler</em> by Fischer, Cytron, and LeBlanc &ndash;
although it might be dated, and if so, I may refer to more
contemporary sources.</p>
<p>My goal here is to implement compilers for the MiniLang and GoLite
languages, whose specifications are given on the course webpage. I may
implement one or both of them via <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>, since
this seems like a modern and indeed lower-level approach.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-rust">Exploring Rust</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, which is often
described to me as the greatest language ever designed. I really don&rsquo;t
know anything about it but I&rsquo;m doubtful.</p>
<p>If I find it interesting, I may try to implement a hopefully useful
data structure in this language.</p>
<h2 id="shader-programming">Shader programming</h2>
<p>I recently watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrHHTQqmAaM">very interesting
video</a> about the global
illumination lighting algorithm Radiance Cascades, designed for and
implemented in the video game Path Of Exile 2.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve studied computer graphics programming before, and I&rsquo;ve always
found it interesting. I have learned about and implemented the
traditional radiance algorithm before, but the implementation was
awful and deeply inefficient. It would be great to revisit this and
get my hands dirty with some more practical shader programming.</p>
<p>I also learned about Shadertoy (<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a>) which
appears to make the distribution and development of little shaders
really simple. It would be great to use this as a little playground
for shader programming exploration.</p>
<h2 id="nessnes-programming">NES/SNES programming</h2>
<p>I have studied NES and SNES programming, but I haven&rsquo;t written or
developed anything. Ever since childhood I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the
EarthBound battle screens and I&rsquo;ve since learned how they were
implemented via HDMA (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjQik7uwLIQ)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjQik7uwLIQ)</a>. It
would be really cool to implement something myself, like an EarthBound
battle screen style demo.</p>
